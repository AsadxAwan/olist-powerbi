# Analysis Report on Brazilian E-Commerce Data from Olist

In this Data Analysis project, I sought utilise publicly available datasets containing Brazilian online retailer – Olist - Company financial information. Information was used to generate important observations and intertwined with recommendations in certain sections

<h2>Section 1 - Sales Trend Overview</h2>

Typically, when it comes to newcomers in a given industry, initial organizational growth can be exponential in nature. From the line plot on the slide, we can observe a Sales trend that indicates growth during the 2016-2018 period.

The sales trend here is pretty stable and predictable, and unsurprisingly has been attracting a lot of media attention, with institutional investors labelling Olist as a ‘unicorn’ which in the world of finance is a term used to describe a highly valued small-to-medium sized organisations. 

When it comes to forecasting the future of Olists sales trend in more general terms, it is safe to assume that this will remain stable and in a state of upwards growth. 

To give an example why, <i>according to recent Reuters article</i>, Olist themselves have made it known that over time and with additional investment, they aspire to diversify their services by including financial services, acquiring smaller companies and expanding their operations abroad in Mexico. Through this particular endeavour, Olist will certainly look to benefit greatly from diversification and fuelling further sales growth.  

In addition to diversification, Olist should certainly look to build on their existing strengths by addressing 2 key drivers behind their sales growth – one being their capacity & ability to process customer purchases and the other being prioritising the sales of certain types of products over others.

<h2>Section 2  – Important Sales Drivers</h2>

<h3>First key driver – Customer Purchase methods</h3>

During analysis, an important driver I identified behind sales included the method of payment undertaken by customers.

From my observations I noted that Credit cards were the dominant method of payment, however upon viewing Olist’s options on purchase options for products via credit, this is best described as being somewhat limited. 

A recommendation here would be to perhaps implement and offer customers with more flexible options when purchasing on credit. A widely known, yet rudimentary example of this would include enabling customers to purchase now pay back 6 months later or alternatively, in instalments. 

I also observed that Boleto was the second most popular source of purchases. 

It should be noted that existing research indicates that Brazilian society, which is Olists native market, can somewhat risk-averse when it comes to sharing personal information on E-Commerce platforms. 
Having said this, a good recommendation here would be to allow visitors to the platform to be able to complete purchases anonymously, with the guarantee that their details won’t be stored on any databases and only used purely for delivery purposes.

Another good recommendation also includes offering discounts for purchases made through the Boleto. Through this approach Olist products become increasingly accessible to customers who do not have a bank account and only rely on Boleto to make purchases on E-Commerce platforms. 

Through optimising the way in which Olist collects payments, this will help facilitate additional revenue capture as the company grows larger in the south American market and gains more customers in the coming years. 


<h3>Second key driver – Product Categories</h3>

A second key driver I observed and considered notable with regards to sales included the types of products sold. “Cool_stuff” which I presumed to be a general term used to describe ‘novelty items’ was the main selling product. Reasons behind this could include the fact that novelty gifts tend to be easier to transport and cheaper to purchase when compared to other types of product categories such as electronics. 

Having said this, a key sales recommendation here includes prioritising certain types of products over others on the Olist E-Commerce platform. Which in this case would be Electronics over the other product categories. 

Now before you say “don’t fix it if it isn’t broken”, consider this - out of the top 5 product categories shown on the ribbon chart on the slide – 2 out of the 5 are related to electronics, with the remaining 3 being very distinct from each other. Now if we expand this range to top 6 product categories, we now have 3 product categories related to electronics in some way – that’s 50% and that’s significant because that shows there’s some commonality between product categories that are in demand.

Through this realisation, Olist can capitalise by organising promotional offers, seasonal offers and bundle packages to accelerate further growth in sales revenue. 

On a final note it should be worth bearing in mind however, that transporting electrical goods can be more costly and more difficult but the upside here is that prioritising the promotion and sales of electrical related goods can greatly increase sales and contribute to further growth.
